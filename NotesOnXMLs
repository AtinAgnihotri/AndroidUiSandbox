# NOTES ON DIFF XMLs
1) AndroidManifest.xml
    > The most imp xml file in your codebase for your app
    > Define general attrs/features of the app
    > attrs like
        * icon, roundIcon
        * label
        * app theme
        * Launcher activity

2) Strings.xml
    > Put the static strings and string-arrays in strings.xml file, and use that instead of hardcoding strings.
    > Can retrieve in layout xml using @+id/string_name
    > Can retrieve in code using getString(R.string.string_name)
    > Can add other strings.xml (For eg, de-rDE/strings.xml  for localisation with exactly the same value as normal one,
     To see that, change the lang of device to desired lang and see the magic happen)

3) Colors.xml
    > Like strings.xml, store the static colors here
    > Define as follows : <color name="color_name">#HEXVAL</color>
    > In layout xml, can use as @color/color_name

4) Styles.xml
    > Define the theme of the application here
    > Can define multiple styles here
    > Can pass these styles to diff activities.
    > Diff activities can have diff styles

5) Menus.xml
    > Not present by default
    > Can be created by creating directory "menu" in res
    > Create a menu resource file inside the created dir, eg "main_menu"
    > Can then create <items></items> inside the menu
    > Necessary to have android:title="some_title" in item

6) Layout.xml
    > Most is known
    > Can create many diff layouts for the same activity
    > Eg : Landscape, Night Mode, Diff API Version
